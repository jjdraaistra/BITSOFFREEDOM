Technology can and must help us move ahead in the fight for an open and just society. But it is clear to us that it can only do so if we use technology that is in harmony with our own values and message, and only
if our use of it is progressive, inspiring and rewarding. As we see it, European digital civil liberties organizations[ must not only take the lead in this, but set the standards as well.](../../../../../Users/nick/Desktop/Evelyn/eu-tooling.bitsoffreedom.nl) Campaign tools that are privacy friendly and mobilize large numbers. Donation software that respects the dignity of donors and contributes to the financial stability of NGOs.

It was for this reason that, in the past year, we analyzed how European NGOs presently utilize digital tools. We focused on three core areas: tooling for external communication (campaigns, mobilization and reaching more people); tooling for research and collecting evidence and tooling for running our workplaces and organizations. We also looked at what is needed and what we can do in the new year to make substantial progress.

Our first interim report, which touched on numerous points for improvement, was received very positively. To sum up, it is clear that we are not making optimum use of technology to achieve our objectives, and that, as a result, opportunities are being missed for converting increased interest in our work into greater engagement vis-Ã -vis our organizations and their goals. So there's much to be done!
