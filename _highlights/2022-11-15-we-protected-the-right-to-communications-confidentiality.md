In 2022, the European Commission finally launched its long-awaited proposal for protecting children and young people from sexual abuse. Extremely important. But the measures proposed by European legislators will have hardly any effect and actually[ make people (including children) who want to communicate online even more vulnerable than they already were](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2022/05/11/europese-commissie-wil-vertrouwelijkheid-op-internet-opheffen/). At the end of the year, the political battle really heated up. The European Parliament was still involved in negotiations concerning which working group was to preside. Simultaneously, member states were consulting in secret, in search of compromises and interpretation.

To make sure that policy makers didn't overlook fundamental human rights, we were continually in Brussels. We spoke with the
representatives of the Dutch government and with numerous MEPs. It's a fact that we achieve more when we join forces with our European colleagues, and for that reason, we coordinated our efforts, our strategy and our message with our European sister organizations.

Because the Netherlands' position is determined in The Hague, we also exerted indirect influence there, e.g., by talking to officials in the Ministry of Justice and Security.

To maximize the pressure on the cabinet, we invested much energy into ensuring that the legislative proposal also got onto the agenda of the House of Representatives. Which worked. The proposed legislation was on the agenda several times, frequently with *our* critical questions. By a large majority, a motion was supported in the House calling on the
cabinet not to accept any European legislative proposal making end-to-end encryption impossible. The rest of the year, we regularly helped House members with the formulation of follow-up questions, in order to compel positive interpretation of the motion.
