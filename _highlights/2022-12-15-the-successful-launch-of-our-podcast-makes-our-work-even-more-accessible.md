Following a successful Big Brother Awards podcast, we launched, in October, our twice-monthly [Bits of Freedom Podcast](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/podcast/afleveringen/): a podcast about everything that has to do with the internet -- on the one hand, to talk about our work in an accessible manner, and on the other, as a space for our wider-ranging interests in internet-related topics.

In the podcast, host Inge and her regular guest, Evelyn, discuss a wide range of topics with BOF policy makers. Each episode also features a phone conversation with someone with a special perspective on the internet. In 2022, we talked to artists Julia Janssen, Dries Depoorter and Eva Line de Boer about their work, with tech-expert Maarten den Braber about Mastodon and with Representative Lisa van Ginneken (D66[]{#anchor-3}) about her departure from Twitter; Robin Pocornie discussed the complaint she submitted to the Netherlands Committee for Human Rights regarding discriminatory proctoring software and Gerbrig
Klos brought us up to date on Amnesty International's efforts to protect the right to demonstrate.

The podcast was well-received and each of the (seven) episodes was listened to ca. 1000 times. For each episode, a transcription was prepared by one of our volunteers.
