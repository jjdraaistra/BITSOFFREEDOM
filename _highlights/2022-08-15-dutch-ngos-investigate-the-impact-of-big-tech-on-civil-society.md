We joined forces with the Public Interest Litigation Project (PILP) to investigate how Big Tech limits the freedom of communication of NGOs in the Netherlands. In this way, we aim to help civil society understand
and minimize manipulation and other harmful effects resulting from the use of Big Tech, among other things. We organized four topic-based sessions (on the climate, women's rights and racism and around migration and the undocumented), which attracted a range of civil society organizations and activists. We wound up speaking with people from as many as nineteen different organizations. We shared knowledge and tools to increase awareness and resilience. In a fifth session, open to
everyone, to take place in February, 2023, we'll give feedback on the findings from the four previous sessions *and* subsequent steps.
