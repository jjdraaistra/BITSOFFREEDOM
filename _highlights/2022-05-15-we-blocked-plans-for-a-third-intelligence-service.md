In 2021, it came to light that the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism (NCTV) had secretly spied on people in the Netherlands. But instead of a good rap on the knuckles, the NCTV was rewarded by the minister for justice and security with a bill to make such unlawful practices legal. This would have ushered-in the Netherlands' third  intelligence service.

We threw everything we had at preventing this from happening. For example, in 2022, we played an important role in the organization of a roundtable in the House of Representatives. In addition to ourselves, the participants included, among others, Amnesty International Nederland, the Dutch Data Protection Authority, the Review Committee on the Intelligence and Security Services (CTIVD), the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) and Prof. Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius.
There was criticism from every quarter (except from the NCTV itself). House members took due notice.

Since the roundtable, the bill has, as far as we're aware, been completely dormant. Until it is withdrawn, or is revisited in order to define the NCTV's coordinating tasks more clearly (nothing more than that), we remain vigilant.
