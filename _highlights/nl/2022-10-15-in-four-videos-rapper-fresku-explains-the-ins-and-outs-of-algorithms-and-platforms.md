In 2022, we launched the four-part video series [*Data. Zo zit dat.*](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/data-zo-zit-dat/) in which rapper and Freedom Ambassador Fresku explores the ins and outs of data together with four young people. In an accessible manner, the four short films provide insight into the risks posed by algorithms and Big Tech. Interesting for young and old alike!

For the project, we collaborated with Controle Alt Delete, the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ECNL), the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) and Public Spaces. Viewers became data-smarter on the subjects of manipulative web design, data-driven profiling, the monopolistic nature of large platforms and [predictive policing](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/video/data-zo-zit-dat/predictive-policing/).

The videos were disseminated via online news media and blogs during Human Rights Week and on Digital Rights Day. They were also shown at a conference on digitization and were broadcast on local TV station AT5 and can be viewed on the [online media-wisdom platform, Cyberschool](https://cyberschool.nl/tips/bitsoffreedom/).

During their launch on our own online channels, the videos reached more than fifty thousand people. The series was shown to an audience of 250 at the Amsterdam debating center, Pakhuis de Zwijger. The potential online reach of the videos via AT5 is two million, and, via Cyberschool.nl, three to four thousand young people.

We're proud of the fact that the videos have already reached a large audience, and, in 2023, we plan to widen their reach even further. We'll continue showing them at events and will keep encouraging teachers to use them in their lessons.
