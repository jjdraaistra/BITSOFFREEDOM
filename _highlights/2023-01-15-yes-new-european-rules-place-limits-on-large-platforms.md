2022 saw the completion of EU legislative procedures concerning the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, resulting in a set of rules for protecting users of large online platforms from the power of these platforms and their toxic revenue models. Fantastic! Initial steps were also taken for implementing the rules in all EU member states. The
first rules will come into force in 2023, and both acts will become fully enforceable in 2024.

Due to lobbying by Bits of Freedom and others regarding the [Digital Services](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2022/09/27/8-nieuwe-regels-die-jou-beter-gaan-beschermen-tegen-online-platformen/)and [Digital Markets Act](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2022/11/10/7-nieuwe-regels-die-de-marktmacht-van-grote-platformen-moeten-tegen-gaan/)s, the resulting legislation was substantially improved in the area of digital rights. For example, a prohibition on advertising targeted at
minors was included; further: chat services must be interoperable and, users of Big Tech will soon be able to shape their online environments much more by modifying recommendation systems and app store data. Hooray!

And lobbying was not the only thing we did last year. We also made these topics more accessible, through a range of awareness projects. We launched a newsletter about online platforms, issued short films explaining platform issues in an accessible manner and reached out to a number of social movements to discuss their use of Big Tech.

Little by little, more and more attention is being paid to the negative effects resulting from the dominant positions of large online platforms. Increasingly, such aspects as disinformation, content harmful to minors and the dangers of addiction are becoming topics of discussion, both in national politics and in the media. In place of social media being perceived in heroic terms, the risks resulting from their revenue models are now being recognized and combatted. Armed with the new legislation, we look forward to continuing the fight in the coming years.
