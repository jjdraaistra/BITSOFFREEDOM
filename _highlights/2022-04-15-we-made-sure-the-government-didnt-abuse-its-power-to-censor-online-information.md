Even officials at the Ministry of Justice and Security have remarked that policy makers often react in an ad-hoc manner when it comes to information on the internet. And if you react in an ad-hoc manner, human rights can be jeopardized. Sometimes this involves the right to privacy, sometimes the right to freedom of expression. What is actually the role of the government with regard to online statements? Do the police have the right to request that information be made inaccessible, and if so,
under what conditions? And what is the role of mayors in maintaining public order? The Ministry wants to develop a framework that provides answers to such questions.

This, of course, is our specialty. Which is why we made sure to get involved in the project in its early stages. Our preparatory work is ensuring that, when the project actually gets going in 2023, we can play a substantive role -- that the minister doesn't just ask us for feedback, but really does something with our advice, that she considers the perspectives of all who are affected by the policy and that all interested parties are heard.

This is essential, as only in this way can policy be crafted that protects human rights and generates broad-based support for the resulting governmental measures.
