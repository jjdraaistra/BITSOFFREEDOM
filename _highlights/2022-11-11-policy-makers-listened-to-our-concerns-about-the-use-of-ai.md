In 2022, the European Parliament and the governments of the EU member states met frequently to discuss new rules for AI. We were active in Brussels and The Hague in order to call maximum attention to the interests of citizens.

We worked out our positions in coordination with our European sister organizations and wrote several amendments to the current proposal. With these as a basis, we lobbied dozens of relevant officials, including AI regulation co-rapporteur Brando Benifei. We were also present as guests of the European Parliament to explain our position on biometric
surveillance in the public space.

In The Hague, we had meetings at the Senate, brought our message to the House of Representatives and, in order to influence the positions of other stakeholders, also spoke at several relevant conferences, including the Fairness in Algorithmic Decision Making Conference.

All of these meetings and appearances bore fruit. Increasingly,
legislation is reflecting greater attention to the importance of rights
of transparency, and more or stricter prohibitions on the use of AI,
including predictive policing, are being enacted. Exactly what we've
been fighting for!
