Dutch municipalities are head-over-heals in love with data. *The more, the better*, the motto seems to be. Be it complex criminality, youth care or combatting fraud: there's no problem that can't be solved with a bit of computation work -- as long as we turn a blind eye to the fact that young people's fundamental rights are being violated and citizens are being used like test objects in municipal experiments.

That's where we come in. We requested data from municipalities to investigate how the ten largest ones approach data, GDPR requests and transparency obligations. We also looked at what resources municipalities make available for attaining compliance with privacy legislation. Our conclusion: municipalities don't comply well at all with legal requirements. Worse yet, only one municipality got a passing grade. Is it just possible that this is a nation-wide problem?

As a result of our investigation, the problem caught the attention of members of the House of Representatives. As a result, the government had to respond to parliamentary questions and the secretary of state for digitization ultimately promised to meet with the Association of Netherlands Municipalities. Together, they reached agreements to ensure that municipalities improve how they approach our privacy. To be continued!
