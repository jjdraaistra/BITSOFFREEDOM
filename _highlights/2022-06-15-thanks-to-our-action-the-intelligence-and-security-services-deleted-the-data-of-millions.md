The intelligence and security services are permitted to collect extremely large quantities of data. But they are also required to discard these as soon as they are no longer needed. However, according to the regulator, that doesn't always happen. Their urgent advice to delete unlawfully stored data was ignored. And because the 'oversight' department of the Review Committee on the Intelligence and Security Services (CTIVD) has no binding powers, that was that.

But not quite. The 'complaints' department of the CTIVD does have binding powers, but may only use them if someone lodges a complaint with them (no joke!). So that's what we did -- and with success. The CTIVD ruled that we were right and ordered the intelligence and security services to delete the data in question. This time, the services had to comply. As a result, millions of citizens were suddenly better protected. Our action also sent an important signal about the (in)effectiveness of the regulatory system (which is in need of strengthening) and demonstrated that the intelligence and security services are not above the law.

Our complaint was mentioned frequently in both the House of Representatives and the media. We thus succeeded in shining a light on something that normally goes on in the shadows -- particularly important, now that the limits to what the intelligence and security services may and may not do are again a topic of debate.
