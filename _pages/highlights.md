The statutory objective of Bits of Freedom is 'to defend and promote digital civil rights in the information society, including the fundamental right to privacy and freedom of communication, and all related rights, in the broadest sense of the word.'

Team
We welcomed three new colleagues last year: Jason van der Leeuw (system administrator), Nadia Benaissa (policy officer) and Bér Engels (communication strategist). Nadia has a background as a GDPR lawyer and previously worked for a large municipality as a data protection officer. In addition to being a true activist at heart, she brings with her interesting experience from the public sector. Nadia will be working with us on a new dossier on data, algorithms and justice (formerly ‘Profiling’). Bér has a background in the music and events industry and previously worked at Cineville. Last but not least, Jason is a self-taught system administrator. His background is in philosophy. Unfortunately, we decided to part ways at the end of the year.

Esther Crabbendam was our campaigner and has become our new movement builder. From 2021 onwards, she will focus on mobilising people in the battle for digital rights. The role of campaigner will be exchanged for that of a fundraiser. This person will be recruited in the year ahead and will be responsible for attracting individual and corporate donors.
Finally, the end of 2020 marked the departure of our graphic designer Karim Khamis. Karim joined Bits of Freedom in 2017 and had a big positive impact on our (visual) communications and on our team. Adjacent to his work for Bits of Freedom, Karim stayed on as art director for Cablai, the design agency he founded with George Adegite. From 2021 onwards Cablai is going to receive Karim's full attention. He will sorely be missed, but we are excitedly awaiting the great projects Cablai will no doubt be churning out.
