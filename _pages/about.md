The statutory objective of Bits of Freedom is "to defend and promote digital civil rights in the information society, including the fundamental right to privacy and freedom of communication, and all related rights, in the broadest sense of the word."

Team <br>
We welcomed three new colleagues last year: Jason van der Leeuw (system administrator), Nadia Benaissa (policy officer) and Bér Engels (communication strategist). Nadia has a background as a GDPR lawyer and previously worked for a large municipality as a data protection officer. In addition to being a true activist at heart, she brings with her interesting experience from the public sector. Nadia will be working with us on a new dossier on data, algorithms and justice (formerly ‘Profiling’). Bér has a background in the music and events industry and previously worked at Cineville. Last but not least, Jason is a self-taught system administrator. His background is in philosophy. Unfortunately, we decided to part ways at the end of the year.

Esther Crabbendam was our campaigner and has become our new movement builder. From 2021 onwards, she will focus on mobilising people in the battle for digital rights. The role of campaigner will be exchanged for that of a fundraiser. This person will be recruited in the year ahead and will be responsible for attracting individual and corporate donors.
Finally, the end of 2020 marked the departure of our graphic designer Karim Khamis. Karim joined Bits of Freedom in 2017 and had a big positive impact on our (visual) communications and on our team. Adjacent to his work for Bits of Freedom, Karim stayed on as art director for Cablai, the design agency he founded with George Adegite. From 2021 onwards Cablai is going to receive Karim's full attention. He will sorely be missed, but we are excitedly awaiting the great projects Cablai will no doubt be churning out.

Board
We said goodbye to our treasurer Clemens la Lau and to Hermine Masmeyer, general board member with a focus on HR. We found two great successors in Wiens van Asselt (treasurer) and Janine Huizenga (general board member). Wiens has a long career behind him as a civil servant for the City of Amsterdam, and Janine is Department Head of Interactive Design at the Hague Royal Academy of Art.
One of the year’s focus points for the board was finding a successor for our chair, Lonneke van der Velden. After having Lonneke aboard for nine years, the board will not only lose a passionate activist, academic and field expert, but also a board member with a great institutional memory. We are therefore very pleased that, after an extensive search, we were able to welcome Sophie Logothetis as chair and that Lonneke was able to help her make a smooth transition into her new role. Sophie works as a programme manager for the EU grant programme Europe for Citizens, which supports projects for civic participation and democratic engagement. She is also the liaison for a European cultural network called EUNIC. We look forward to the expertise and new perspectives Sophie will bring to the organisation!
Finally, the board and the director drew up a new multi-annual strategy for 2021-2025 and were in frequent contact concerning the impact of Covid-19 on the organisation and the team.

Volunteers
Covid-19, in combination with the lack of a movement builder, made this a rather uneventful year for our volunteers. The most important volunteer project we were engaged in in 2020 was the relaunch of the Internet Freedom Toolbox. In addition, our translation volunteers were as busy as ever, and we now have an impressive new group of creatives who will help us with our communications. We are very grateful to everyone who helped us last year!

Advisory Board
The advisory board is composed of prominent figures with expertise in the fields of law, politics, media/communication, art, technology, and business. In 2020, the advisory board consisted of the following members: Jaap-Henk Hoepman (chairman), Amade M’charek, Anneke Jansen, Antoinette Hertsenberg, Eleni Kosta, Linda Duits, Lineke Sneller, Maxim Februari, Mohamed el Maslouhi, Olaf Kolkman, Ot van Daalen and Sarah Hagens. The members of the advisory board do not receive any form of compensation, for expenses or otherwise.

Our international network
We are one of the founders and active members of European Digital Rights (EDRi), a network of over 40 organisations fighting for internet freedom. We contributed to EDRi’s new multi-year strategy and attended the General Assembly, which was held online this year. We also provided input to the Digital Freedom Fund and EDRi in the context of decolonising the digital rights field. Finally, we helped 13 organisations localise My Data Done Right (translations and building a database of local organisations) and consolidated the way these organisations work together.

Our role as an employer
The health of our employees is deserving of even greater attention during a pandemic. A few times a week, we took stock of how everyone was doing, and took steps to help the team cope with the unusually stressful situation and changing working conditions. We also found ways to see each other safely face-to-face on a regular basis, even managing to get the whole team together in a Covid-19-proof situation twice.

As an employer, we have identified five areas of focus: offering livelihood security, offering equal opportunities, investing in professional development, setting up staff members so they can be in control of their work, and supporting staff in maintaining a proper work-life balance. Four policy documents will be completed in the coming year in regard of these five points: for the engagement of a confidential adviser and the establishment of a complaints committee, an update of our partner leave policy, a sabbatical policy and a pension policy. We will also regularly evaluate the workload of our staff and our working habits, and we will have an external assessment conducted of our remuneration policy and salary structure.
