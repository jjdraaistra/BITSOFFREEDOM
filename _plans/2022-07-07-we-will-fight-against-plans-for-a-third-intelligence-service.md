In 2021, it came to light that the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism (NCTV) had secretly spied on people in the Netherlands. But instead of a good rap on the knuckles, the NCTV was rewarded by the minister for justice and security with a bill to make such unlawful practices legal. This would have ushered-in the Netherlands' third intelligence service.

In 2022, we slowed down the minister's plans by mobilizing broad-based resistance. In 2023, we will ensure that the bill intended to legalize the unlawful surveillance practices of the NCTV can only be used for the purpose of defining existing intelligence tasks more clearly.
