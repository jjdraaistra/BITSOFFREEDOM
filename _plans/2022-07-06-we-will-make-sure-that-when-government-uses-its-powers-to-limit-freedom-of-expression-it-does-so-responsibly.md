The Ministry of Justice and Security develops guidelines for determining whether the government should remove information from the internet. But at present, this is done in an all too ad-hoc manner, so that human rights can be jeopardized.

We got involved in the design process already in the project's early stages. But, as the project will first really get going in 2023, what will our position be then? -- the government may only meddle with our freedom of expression under strict conditions! But we also have constructive feedback: we want everyone affected by this policy to be heard, in order to ensure that everyone's rights and freedoms are protected.
