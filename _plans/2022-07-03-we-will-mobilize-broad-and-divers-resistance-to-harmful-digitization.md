Digitization is omnipresent. Those affected worst by it are not always well-represented in The Hague. We want all Netherlands-based organizations that are fighting for an open and just society also to have the tools they need for dealing with the technological dimensions of the problems and developments they are confronting. And we also want to ensure that they realize how technology can actually make it easier for them to attain their objectives. Only with a broad-based movement championing the interests of everyone living in the Netherlands, will we be able to help keep digitization on a good path.
