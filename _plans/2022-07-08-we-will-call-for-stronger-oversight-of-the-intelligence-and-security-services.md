In 2022, the policy labyrinth of legislation for the intelligence and security services was further expanded, this time with a new, so-called temporary legislative supplement. Now, the proposed Cyber Act is intended to give the intelligence and security services yet more room to collect and use data. By means of the proposed legislation, government ministers also want to reduce oversight. A very bad move indeed, as strong oversight of the intelligence and security services is of crucial importance. It is one of the few ways available to society for ensuring that these services do their work well, but in accordance with the law.

In the coming year, we will do everything in our power to get oversight of the intelligence and security services strengthened and to prevent them from being given expanded powers.
