Violations of privacy on menstruation apps are rampant. People who menstruate and use such apps share a great deal of personal (medical) data on them, from which even pregnancy or abortion can be deduced. It's obvious that such data must be treated with care.

Following a comprehensive investigation by Privacy International some years ago, we are now curious: what is the current state of affairs? In 2023, we will be carrying out a technical investigation into a number of widely used apps.
