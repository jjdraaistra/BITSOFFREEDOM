In the past year, we took part in several cooperative efforts, with an increasingly diverse range of partners. Together with the Public Interest Litigation Project, we organized a number of workshops for organizations fighting against racism and for the climate, migrants, the undocumented and women's rights. With them, we investigated the positive and negative impact of Big Tech on their attainment of their objectives. In partnership with Controle Alt Delete, the Digital Freedom Fund and EDRi, we organized, in Amsterdam, the first European edition of the annual Color of Surveillance conference, which explores the interface between racism and surveillance. We organized a meeting location for activists and professionals active in this field and moderated a panel discussion on the current Dutch childcare benefits scandal. we launched the four-part video series [*Data. Zo zit dat*](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/data-zo-zit-dat/)*.* in cooperation with Controle Alt Delete, the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ECNL), the Centre for research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) and Public Spaces. Finally, we joined forces with Amnesty International, the Open State Foundation and Waag in connection with our advocacy activities in The Hague.
