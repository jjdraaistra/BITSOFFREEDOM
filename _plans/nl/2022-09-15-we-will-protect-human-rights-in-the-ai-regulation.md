In the past year, we substantially influenced the European proposal for rules around AI. For the planned legislation, there is increasing focus on rights of transparency and more or stricter prohibitions on AI applications, including predictive policing and biometric surveillance in the public space. Exactly what we have been fighting for! But there is still much to be done. That is why in 2023 we will continue to strive for a law that provides good protection of human rights.
