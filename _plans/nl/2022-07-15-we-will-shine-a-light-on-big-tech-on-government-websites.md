Increasingly, our contact with public and semi-public organizations is via the internet. Whether you need to contact Tax and Customs, your municipality, a care provider or your child's elementary school, there's a good chance that you'll need to use their websites. Unfortunately, many of these sites were not made with privacy in mind. Many of them contain Google Analytics or other trackers. In 2022, we began analyzing public and semi-public websites and the tracking that takes place on
them. In the new year, we plan to regularly call attention to the need for improvements, and to make our tooling available to our European sister organizations, to make it easy for them to carry out the same research in their countries.
