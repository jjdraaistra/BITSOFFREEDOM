Europe-wide, new rights are in force which better protect citizens from misleading information on the big platforms. That is fantastic news! But not everyone knows about it ... That's why we're currently working on a national and European campaign in cooperation with a broad-based coalition in order to raise awareness of it. In particular, we want to strengthen the position of public-interest groups that use online tools to attain their goals.
