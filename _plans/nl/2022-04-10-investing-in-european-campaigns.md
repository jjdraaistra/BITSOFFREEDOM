We're a small organization. But through smart use of lobbying and public pressure, we nevertheless get a lot done. We want to take the experience we've gained in the field of public communication and apply it to Europe-wide campaigns. Because more and more important legislation now comes out of Brussels, and enforcement at the national level is increasingly taking on a European dimension. For this reason, we plan, in the coming year, to develop new tools and share these, and our expertise, with our partners. We're also currently working with other European organizations on a pilot campaign, whose central theme is increasing awareness about the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act and disseminating information on their enforcement. We hope that this pilot can serve as a model for future large-scale campaigns.
