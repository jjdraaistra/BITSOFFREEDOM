We have adopted policy that encourages us to supervise a minimum of two trainees and one student per year. One reason for this is our desire to exert influence on our own field of activity, including by increasing the influx of talented starters in civil society. But it is also because we believe that there is much that we can learn from trainees and students. We consciously give these positions in our organization to individuals who have less access to their chosen field or are
underrepresented in it.
