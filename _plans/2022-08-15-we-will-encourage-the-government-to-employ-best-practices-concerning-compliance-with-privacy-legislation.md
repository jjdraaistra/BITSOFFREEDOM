In 2022, we investigated how the ten biggest Dutch municipalities approach data, GDPR requests and transparency obligations. We also looked at what resources municipalities make available for attaining compliance with privacy legislation. Our conclusion: municipalities don't comply well at all with legal requirements. Worse yet, only one municipality got a passing grade.

As a result of our investigation, the government had to respond to parliamentary questions and the secretary of state for digitization reached agreements with the Association of Netherlands Municipalities concerning improvements. This year, around the fifth anniversary of the General Data Protection Regulation, we will again call attention to this topic. What progress has been made in the past twelve months?
