We're a small organization. But through smart use of lobbying and public pressure, we nevertheless get a lot done. Because more and more important legislation now comes out of Brussels and important decisions are being taken there in greater frequency, we want to take the experience we've gained in the field of public communication and apply it to Europe-wide campaigns. For this reason, we plan, in the coming year, to develop new tools and share these, and our expertise, with our partners. We're also currently working with other European organizations on a pilot campaign, to serve as a model for future large-scale campaigns.
