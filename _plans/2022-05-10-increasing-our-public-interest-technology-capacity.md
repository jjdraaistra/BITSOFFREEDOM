To increase our capacity in the field of European digital rights, we have added two public interest technologists to our team, namely a researcher and a web developer.

Our technical researcher, Joran, collects evidence of unlawful practices within Big Tech and our data-driven government. This knowledge is translated into policy change, increasing awareness and legal actions. In his initial months with us, Joran immersed himself in the world of policy, created an investigative infrastructure and began building a European network of tech-experts, lawyers and campaigners. This year, we plan to initiate a number of small-scale campaigns based on technical research, as well as to fortify the new investigative infrastructure to facilitate effective cooperation.

In 2022, our web developer, Martijn, initiated an investigation into tooling in the field of digital rights. As with digital civil liberties organizations, it is imperative that our use of technology be in harmony with our values, be convincing and inspire. At present, that is still not the case in a number of areas. The initial interim report is out. Martijn has also designed a number of new campaign tools and tested them within our organization. In the coming year, these will be further
developed and made available to all our European affiliates.
